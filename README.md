# Digital Humans for Godot Engine

This project aims at providing shaders and materials for creating realistic
looking characters in games made with Godot Engine 4. It can serve as a learning
resource, but it is equally suited to be used directly in games.

## What's in the Box?

- [An eye shader & model](#eye-shader) with iris refraction and tons of configurable parameters
